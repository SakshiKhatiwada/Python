# SECTION input
# x = input("Enter any number")
# y = input("Enter another number")

# NOTE tip: input always gives us string, we need to convert them as per the need

# x = int(x)
# y = int(y)
# print("sum = ", x+y)

# SECTION type

# print(type(4))
# print(type("sakshi"))

#  NOTE  c=2+3i  ---------->not i, it uses j
# c=2+3j
# print(type(c))

# d = None    # NOTE NoneType, None is assigned when there's no value assigned to the variable
# print(type(d))

complex_number = complex(5, 7)
# print(type(complex_number)) #NOTE there's complex number
# print(type(2.12))

# str = 's'
# print(type(str))

# SECTION list, tuple, set, dictionary

# l =[ 1, 2, 3]
# print(type(l)) #NOTE type -> list

# t = (1,2,3)
# print(type(t)) #NOTE type -> tuple: similar to list, but is immutable -> can't modify once created

# s = {1,2,3,1}
# print(type(s)) #NOTE type -> set, should be unique
# print(s) #{1, 2, 3}

# items = "hello"
# dictionary = {"items" : "value"}
