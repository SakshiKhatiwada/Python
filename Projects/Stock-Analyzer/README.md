Some Definitons:

#### Moving Averages (MA)
A moving average smooths out the price over a certain period so you can see the trend clearly — like the “vibe” of the price.

#### Volatility
Volatility = how much the stock price bounces around over time.

- High volatility = price jumps up & down a lot (like a hyper puppy)

- Low volatility = price moves smoothly and calmly

- calculated using: rolling standard deviation

- Often used in option pricing, risk assessment, and trend confirmation
